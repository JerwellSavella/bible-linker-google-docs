# Other copyrights
The Bibles and languages initially supported came from [versions listed in jw.org](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/) and [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e). The [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511) of these websites do not allow the sharing of their contents. However, it allows [linking to these websites](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511&par=21-23), which is what this script does.
