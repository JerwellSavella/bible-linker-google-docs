# Privacy Policy

**Bible Linker does not collect any of your data.** Period. ('cause this ain't business, you know 😁)

Of course it uses Google APIs to access your document to create links in them. It also takes note the last Bible version you used and saves this to your Google account. Access of those data is temporary and used only while Bible Linker is processing links. **After it's done, it's done.** Bible Linker forgets about what it processed, and all your Google data (including the contents of your document) stays in your Google account.

Bible Linker's temporary access to your data follows [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).

Check the code, it's all there 😉 https://github.com/majal/bible-linker-google-docs/blob/main/Code.gs
