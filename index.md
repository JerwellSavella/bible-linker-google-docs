title: Bible Linker for Google Docs
---

## What does it do?
This script or add-on will find Bible verses in your Google Document and then turn them into links. The links will point to an online Bible of your choice. Why do it manually if you can automate it? ðŸ˜‰

## How to use
1. In your Google Document, click **Extensions > Apps Script.**
2. In the page that will open, **copy and paste** the contents of **[Code.gs](https://github.com/majal/bible-linker-google-docs/blob/main/Code.gs).**
3. **Save.** You may now close the Apps Script window and **refresh** your document.
4. Find **_Bible Linker_** in the Menu. Enjoy!
5. **Tip:** If there is no selected text, Bible Linker will process all verses in the whole document. If you highlighted a selection, it will only process that selected portion of the document.

## Other copyrights
The Bibles and languages initially supported came from [versions listed in jw.org](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/) and [Watchtower Online Library](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e). The [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511) of these websites do not allow the sharing of their contents. However, it allows [linking to these websites](https://www.jw.org/finder?prefer=content&wtlocale=E&docid=1011511&par=21-23), which is what this script does.
